# NightLight
Brighten up images with non machine-learning algorithm

This program requires additional setup if use of a webcam is desired. This
program uses the 'MATLAB Support Package for USB Webcams'.
This can be found at the following link.

ALTERNATIVELY, if the program is run and the user attempts to use the webcam,
and error will appear in the console with a direct link which states

"MATLAB Support Package for USB Webcams has not been installed. Open Add-On Explorer to install the Webcam Support Package."

Clicking "Add-On Explorer" will take users immediately to the link, with an option
to install the package.

To use the program, run the program and a GUI will appear.
Two options are available for use of the application.

Choosing 'Load Image' will cause a file chooser to appear, allowing an image to be
loaded in and have the NightLight brightening applied.

The other 'Web Cam' option will open up another GUI.
Two options will be available - "Take Picture" and "Preview"

"Take Picture" will immediately snap a photo, with no Preview and then
show the processed image in the window once finished.

"Preview" will open a interface showing a live view of what the camera sees,
and pressing a keyboard button such as spacebar, will take a photo and being to
process it.
