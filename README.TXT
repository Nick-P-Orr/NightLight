# NightLight
Brighten up images with non machine-learning algorithm


WEBCAM SETUP
This program requires additional setup if use of a webcam is desired. This
program uses the 'MATLAB Support Package for USB Webcams'.
This can be found at the following link.

ALTERNATIVELY, if the program is run without the webcam support package,
and the user attempts to use the webcam feature in NightLight,
an error will appear in the console with a direct link which states

"MATLAB Support Package for USB Webcams has not been installed.
Open Add-On Explorer to install the Webcam Support Package."

Clicking "Add-On Explorer" will take users immediately to the link, with an option
to install the package.


USING NIGHTLIGHT

To use the program, run the program and a GUI will appear.
Two options are available for use of the application.

Choosing 'Load Image' will open a file chooser, allowing an image to be
loaded in and have the NightLight brightening applied.

The other 'Web Cam' option will open up another GUI.
Two options will be available - "Take Picture" and "Preview"

"Take Picture" will immediately snap a photo, with no preview and then
the processed image will appear in the window once processing has finished.

"Preview" will open an interface showing a live view of what the camera sees,
and pressing a keyboard button such as spacebar, will take a photo and begin to
process it.
