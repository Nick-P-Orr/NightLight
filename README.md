# NightLight
Brighten up images with non machine-learning algorithm

Improve brightness of images while preserving color accuracy, and maintaining image clarity

Implementation plan:
-Convert image to black and white
-Edge detection to pull different layers of scene
-Calculate average intensity of layers
-Compare intensities of each layer
-Use gamma + white balance correction to brighten each layer of color image
-Recombine layers

3/20: Collect images, additional research in existing techniques and solutions, begin writing code

3/20-4/5: Implement algorithm according to implementation plan
 compare results to preexisting solutions

Remaining Time: Make changes to algorithm to improve results
